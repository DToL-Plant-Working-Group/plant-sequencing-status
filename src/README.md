# Pipeline

Short and sweet, run with:

```bash
bash update.bash
```

## Genome sizes

The genome sizes are taken from the genomescope estimates and also the length of the assemblies themselves. Just run each script as they are, should put the correct data in the `data` dir.

Then to get a better formatted dataset, run the `format_genome_sizes.R`.
